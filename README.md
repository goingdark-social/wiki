# Going Dark Wiki

Community wiki for [goingdark.social](https://goingdark.social).
Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the Hugo Blox documentation theme.
The site loads in dark mode by default, and you can switch themes from the header.

## Local development

Install the extended version of Hugo, Node, and the Tailwind command line tool. The theme builds its styles with Tailwind, so the tool has to be on your path.

```shell
npm install -g tailwindcss
hugo server
```

The site runs at `http://localhost:1313`.

## Linting

[Vale](https://vale.sh) checks the docs with project-specific rules in `.vale/Project` along with the Write Good, Microsoft, and Google packages. These rules cover Fediverse terms, require alt text, and prefer code formatting for handles. Docs in `content/docs/legal/` are excluded.

1. Run `vale sync` once to download the external packages.
2. Install the `pre-commit` tool with `pre-commit install`.
3. It runs `vale` on staged Markdown files.

Use `pre-commit run --files path/to/file.md` to lint a file manually. The workflow still lints all Markdown files in `content/` and the root README on each push and pull request.

## Deployment

Commits to `main` deploy to GitHub Pages via the included workflow.

## Funding

The server runs at home, and personal funds pay the hosting costs. Help keep it running at <https://ko-fi.com/goingdark>.
