# Standard Workflow

1. **Intake**
   - Moderators receive reports via the app's Report tool.
   - Appeals arrive via the in-app **Appeal** page.
   - Check if the issue falls under a playbook category.

2. **Evidence capture**  
   - Record account ID, post ID, screenshot if ephemeral.  
   - Store securely according to [Evidence](/docs/mods/evidence/).  

3. **Apply playbook**  
   - Follow the decision matrix for the relevant category.  

4. **Action**  
   - Choose proportionate action (see [Actions](/docs/mods/actions/)).  

5. **Notification**  
   - Send appropriate template from [Templates](/docs/mods/templates/).  

6. **Logging**  
   - Record action for transparency and metrics.  

7. **Closure**  
   - Mark case resolved. Forward to administrator or legal if required.
