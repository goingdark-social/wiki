# Child sexual exploitation material playbook

## Scope
Covers images or posts exploiting minors.  
This connects to [Rule 6 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/06_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
Material that exploits minors is illegal and deeply harmful. We don't tolerate it. Protecting children and keeping this content off our server is essential.

## How we handle this
Any post or account sharing child sexual abuse material is removed and suspended immediately. We alert the site administrators and, when required, report the incident to the appropriate authorities. We log account details, links, and known hashes to aid investigations.

## What people can expect
If we suspend an account for this reason, the message states: "Content involving minors is illegal and has been reported. Your account is suspended."

## Protecting the wider community
Instances that distribute this material are blocked or limited so it never reaches our members.

## If you disagree
Appeals are only considered for mistaken identification or account restoration. Illegal material is never reinstated. We keep evidence for one year in case law enforcement or appeals require it.
