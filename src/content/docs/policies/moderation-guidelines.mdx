## Actions

In-app notifications are sent for all moderation actions.

* **Sensitive**: restrict visibility of specific content.
* **Freeze**: temporarily lock account activity.

## Behavior mapping

* Spam or mass advertisement: reduce visibility or suspend.
* Harassment or hate: warn then suspend or delete.
* Content violating laws: suspend and report.
* Bot misuse: restrict or suspend.
* Malicious domains: block the domain.
* NSFW: occasional with a Content Warning (CW) is fine. Primarily explicit accounts → warn, limit if needed, ask to move; suspend only if refused after grace period.
