## Purpose

goingdark.social is where homelab tinkerers, privacy advocates, and developers gather to share knowledge and take control of their digital lives.
We keep things intentionally small so newcomers get noticed, introductions get boosted, and people can actually have conversations without getting lost in the noise.

These guidelines explain how we keep this place welcoming for everyone. They're here to protect people, not create a bunch of bureaucratic rules.

## Disallowed content and activity

The following actions violate the rules and can lead to moderation:

- **Spam and scams.** Unsolicited promotions, engagement farming, phishing, malware, or harmful links.  
- **Harassment.** Stalking, doxing, impersonation, coordinated harassment, or targeted threats.  
- **Hate and discrimination.** Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, religious bigotry, xenophobia, casteism, or any form of demeaning identity based content.  
- **Misinformation that causes harm.** False or misleading claims that endanger health, safety, or public trust.  
- **Explicit content.** Nudity, gore, or other graphic material must always be behind a content warning (CW). However, graphic sexual content is prohibited from public timelines, even with a CW. All explicit content is subject to [Rule 3](/docs/policies/rules/03_keep-it-clean/).  
- **Automated posting without approval.** Bots must follow the [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/rules/bots/). Moderators remove unapproved bots.
- **Unlawful content.** Anything prohibited under EU or Swedish law, including CSAM, extremist materials, and incitement to harm.
- **Disruptive use.** Flooding timelines, excessive posting, mass unsolicited mentions, or degrading server performance.
 
## Adult content and NSFW

People share art, body positive posts, and adult themes on Mastodon. That's welcome.

- Always put NSFW behind a **Content Warning (CW)**.
- Keep it legal and consensual. Never anything involving minors.
- Occasional NSFW is fine. If an account is mostly explicit sexual content, even with CWs, it doesn’t fit the tone of this server. We’ll nudge first. If it stays primarily explicit, we’ll ask you to move to an adult focused server.

## Moderator actions

Moderation exists to protect members and the community. Actions include:

- **Warning.** A private message explaining the issue.  
- **Restricting visibility.** Posts visible only to followers, not in public timelines.  
- **Suspension.** Temporary or permanent account removal.  
- **Content removal.** Posts, media, or accounts deleted if harmful or unlawful.  
- **Escalation.** Reports forwarded to hosting providers or authorities where required by law.  

For serious violations (harassment, unlawful content, explicit hate), suspension happens without delay.  

---

## Appeals and transparency

- Members can appeal moderation decisions through the **Appeal** option on the warning page (one appeal within 20 days).  
- Moderators review appeals and provide decisions.  
- Decisions are final unless new evidence emerges.  
- An annual [Moderation Report](/docs/policies/moderation-report/) summarizes numbers of reports, actions, and blocks.  

---

## Language and content rules

- Posts in any European language are welcome. English and Swedish are most common.  
- Moderators review content in unsupported languages if necessary.  
- Sensitive media (nudity, graphic content, or political imagery that disturbs) must include a Content Warning.  
- Content prohibited under EU law isn't permitted.  

---

## Participation

This isn’t a server, it’s a community:  

- Boost newcomers’ #introduction posts to help them connect.  
- Share self-hosting setups, open source tools, and privacy tips.  
- Join in discussions without gatekeeping (excluding or discouraging newcomers). Beginners are welcome.  
- Volunteer to help with moderation, translation, or documentation if you want to contribute more.  

---

## Off platform behavior

Harassment or abusive activity that happens off Mastodon but impacts members (for example, organized harassment campaigns) can still lead to moderation action on Mastodon.  

---

## Reporting

- Use the **Report** option on any post or profile. This is the only way to report content or accounts.
- Reports go directly to the moderator team; outcomes are shared in-app when appropriate.

## Final note

community health depends on everyone.  
If in doubt: ask, tag sensitive content, and respect each other.  
goingdark.social is small on purpose. Let’s keep it safe and welcoming.
