## Purpose

goingdark.social is a privacy-focused Mastodon server for people who enjoy technology, open source, and respectful conversation.  
We are small on purpose. We value being a space where newcomers get noticed, introductions get boosted, and discussion stays human-sized.  

These guidelines set out what behavior is expected, what is disallowed, and how moderation works. They exist to protect people, not restrict them unnecessarily.  

---

## Expected Behavior

- **Be respectful.** Disagree without hostility. Listen before responding.  
- **Be inclusive.** Encourage diverse voices, respect pronouns, welcome newcomers.  
- **Be mindful.** Tag sensitive media, avoid flooding timelines, remember others read differently.  
- **Be constructive.** Share ideas, tools, and feedback in a way that helps others learn.  
- **Be responsible.** Respect privacy, do not share others’ personal info without consent.  

---

## Disallowed Content & Activity

The following are not allowed, and may lead to moderation actions:

- **Spam and scams.** Unsolicited promotions, engagement farming, phishing, malware, or harmful links.  
- **Harassment.** Stalking, doxxing, impersonation, brigading, or targeted abuse.  
- **Hate and discrimination.** Racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, religious bigotry, xenophobia, casteism, or any form of demeaning identity-based content.  
- **Misinformation that causes harm.** False or misleading claims that may endanger health, safety, or public trust.  
- **Pornography and sex work promotion.** Explicit sexual content and solicitation are not permitted here.  
- **Untagged sensitive media.** Nudity, gore, or graphic violence must always be behind a content warning.  
- **Automated posting without approval.** Bots must follow the [Bot Policy](/docs/policies/rules/bots/). Unapproved bots are suspended.  
- **Illegal content.** Anything illegal under EU or Swedish law, including CSAM, extremist propaganda, and incitement to violence.  
- **Disruptive use.** Flooding timelines, excessive posting, mass unsolicited mentions, or degrading server performance.

## Moderator Actions

Moderation exists to protect members and the community. Actions may include:

- **Warning.** A private message explaining the issue.  
- **Silencing.** Posts visible only to followers, not in public timelines.  
- **Suspension.** Temporary or permanent account removal.  
- **Content removal.** Posts, media, or accounts deleted if harmful or illegal.  
- **Escalation.** Reports may be forwarded to hosting providers or authorities where required by law.  

For serious violations (harassment, illegal content, explicit hate), suspension may be immediate.  

---

## Appeals & Transparency

- Members may appeal moderation decisions through [Appeals](/docs/legal/appeals/).  
- Appeals are reviewed by at least two moderators or admins.  
- Decisions are final unless new evidence is presented.  
- An annual [Moderation Report](/docs/policies/moderation-report/) summarises numbers of reports, actions, and blocks.  

---

## Language & Content Rules

- Posts in any European language are welcome. English and Swedish are most common.  
- Content in unsupported languages may be reviewed if moderation is not possible.  
- Sensitive media (nudity, violence, political imagery likely to disturb) must be tagged with a Content Warning.  
- Illegal material under EU law is strictly forbidden.  

---

## Participation

This is not just a server, it’s a community:  

- Boost newcomers’ #introduction posts to help them connect.  
- Share self-hosting setups, open source tools, and privacy tips.  
- Join in discussions without gatekeeping — beginners welcome.  
- Volunteer to help with moderation, translation, or documentation if you want to contribute more.  

---

## Off-Platform Conduct

Harassment or abusive activity that happens off-platform but impacts our members (e.g. brigading, stalking, organized harassment campaigns) may still lead to moderation action here.  

---

## Reporting

- Use the **Report** button on any post or profile.
- Reports go directly to the admin/moderator team.
- For urgent or complex issues, use the in-app Appeal button on the warning page. If the site is unavailable, send a DM to `@fanfare@goingdark.social`.
- Reports are reviewed promptly. Outcomes may be communicated if appropriate.

## Final Note

Community health depends on all of us.  
If in doubt: ask, tag sensitive content, and respect each other.  
goingdark.social is small on purpose — let’s keep it safe and welcoming.
