We run everything in the open because transparency builds trust and lets the community actually contribute to how this place works.

### What's public

- **Wiki:** This site explains how the instance works.
- **Infrastructure as code:** The Kubernetes setup is defined as code.
- **App manifests:** Mastodon manifests and related configuration files are versioned.
- **Issues and discussions:** Ideas, questions, and decisions live in GitHub Discussions.

Everything lives in public repositories in the goingdark-social GitHub organization. Feel free to poke around, suggest changes, or learn from how we've set things up.

### Why we do this

**Transparency:** Anyone can read the code and suggest changes - no black boxes here.
**Reproducibility:** You could rebuild our entire setup from the same files if you wanted to.
**Community input:** Changes get discussed openly in pull requests and GitHub discussions.

### How to follow along

- Read the docs here for policies and guides.
- Track changes in pull requests.
- Join feature talks in GitHub Discussions.
- Open a small, focused pull request when ready.
