goingdark.social is a Mastodon server for homelab tinkerers, privacy advocates, and developers taking control of their digital lives.


The service is run by Going Dark, a small community based in the EU. All our infrastructure code is public on GitHub if you want to see how it's built.

We host on Hetzner to keep things reliable, and community donations help cover the costs. Learn how to help at [Support Us](/docs/user/support-us/)
