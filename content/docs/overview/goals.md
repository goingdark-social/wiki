goingdark.social is where homelab tinkerers, privacy advocates, and developers hang out to share what they're building.

Whether you're setting up your first Pi-hole, managing a full rack, or just believe in digital independence, you'll find your people here.

We're not just talking about taking control of our data - we're actually doing it. People here run their own infrastructure, experiment with new tools, and share what they've learned.

Long term, we want to keep this place small, sustainable, and community funded. Community donations through [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark) help cover hosting costs and keep us independent.
