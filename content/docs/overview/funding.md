We host on Hetzner to provide reliable service, and community donations help cover the costs. To keep things sustainable and make sure we don't vanish, we're working toward covering hosting costs through the community.

If you'd like to help keep the lights on, chip in at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark).

Every donation helps cover the hosting bill.
