We host on Hetzner to keep things reliable, and community donations help cover the costs. If you like what we do, you can help keep the lights on.

## Donation Options

- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/goingdark) - one-off or recurring tips.


## How We Use Funds

Money goes toward:

- Hosting and power costs
- Hardware upgrades and replacements
- Domain names and backups
- Occasional moderation tools

You can see what it actually costs to run this place in our [transparency section](/docs/transparency/current-costs/).

Thank you for helping us stay online.
