Welcome to goingdark.social! This guide will help you get started in our community of homelab tinkerers, privacy advocates, and developers.

## what's Mastodon?

Mastodon is a decentralized social network that's part of the broader "fediverse." Unlike traditional social media platforms, Mastodon consists of many independent servers (called instances) that can communicate with each other.

## What makes us different

We run glitch-soc (a Mastodon fork) with 1000 character posts, perfect for sharing configs, setup stories, or detailed thoughts about your latest project. Our community is all about people who are actively building alternatives rather than just complaining about Big Tech.

## Creating Your Account

1. **Visit our instance**: Go to [goingdark.social](https://goingdark.social)
2. **Sign up**: Click "Sign up" and fill out the registration form
3. **Choose your username**: Pick a username that represents you well
4. **Set up your profile**: Add a profile picture, bio, and display name

## First Steps

### Complete Your Profile

- **Profile Picture**: Upload an avatar that represents you
- **Header Image**: Add a banner image (optional)
- **Bio**: Write a brief description about yourself
- **Display Name**: This can be different from your username

### Understanding the Interface

- **Home Timeline**: Shows posts from people you follow
- **Local Timeline**: Shows public posts from our instance
- **Federated Timeline**: Shows public posts from across the fediverse
- **Notifications**: Shows interactions with your posts

### Making Your First Post

1. Click the compose button (pencil icon)
2. Write your post (called a "toot")
3. Choose your privacy level:
   - **Public**: Visible to everyone
   - **Unlisted**: Public but not on timelines
   - **Followers-only**: Only your followers can see
   - **Direct**: Only mentioned users can see

### Finding People to Follow

- Check the **Local Timeline** for interesting local users
- Use the **Search** function to find specific people
- Look at who others are following and interacting with
- Browse hashtags that interest you

## Community Guidelines

Before you start posting, check out our [community guidelines](../community/community-guidelines.md) and [rules](../policies/rules/). We're welcoming to newcomers and love questions about self-hosting, privacy tools, or whatever tech projects you're working on.

## Getting Help

- **Reporting Issues**: Learn how to [report problems](reporting.md)
- **Migration**: If you're moving from another instance, see our [migration guide](migration.md)

## Privacy and Safety

### Content Warnings

Use content warnings (CW) for:

- Sensitive topics
- Spoilers
- Long posts
- Potentially triggering content

### Blocking and Muting

- **Block**: Prevents all interaction with a user
- **Mute**: Hides their posts from your timeline
- **Hide Boosts**: Hide someone's boosts without unfollowing

### Two-factor authentication

We strongly recommend enabling 2FA in your account settings for additional security.

## Advanced Features

### Hashtags

- Use hashtags to make your posts discoverable
- Follow hashtags you're interested in
- Keep hashtags relevant and don't overuse them

### Lists

Create lists to organize the people you follow into different categories.

### Filters

Set up filters to hide posts containing specific words or phrases.

## Mobile Apps

While you can use Mastodon in your web browser, there are many excellent mobile apps available:

- **Official Mastodon app** (iOS/Android)
- **Tusky** (Android)
- **Toot!** (iOS)
- **Fedilab** (Android)
