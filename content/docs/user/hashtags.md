Hashtags help people discover your posts on Mastodon. Unlike Twitter or Instagram, it doesn't use algorithms to show you content. Instead, hashtags connect your posts with people interested in those topics. These tips match how our instance behaves.

## Why posts don't get seen

Mastodon works differently than algorithm driven social media. There's no recommendation engine pushing content to people. If you skip hashtags, only your followers will see your posts.

## How people find posts

When someone searches for a hashtag or follows one, your posts with that tag appear in their results. That's usually how people outside your follower network discover what you share.

## Creating good hashtags

Add the `#` symbol before relevant words. Sharing cat photos? Use `#Cats` or `#CatsOfMastodon`.

For several words, combine them and capitalize each word: `#CatsOfMastodon`. That format helps screen readers pronounce hashtags well for people who rely on them.

## Choosing the right tags

Search for your topic to see which hashtags people actually use. Mix popular tags like `#Photography` with specific ones like `#FilmPhotography`. Popular tags reach more people but move quickly. Specific tags reach engaged communities.

## Hashtag placement

Put hashtags anywhere in your post. For a cleaner appearance, add them below a blank line at the end. They'll display in smaller text but work the same way.

## Finding content

Search hashtags to find posts and communities. Follow hashtags to see related posts in your home timeline, even from people you don't follow yet.

## Common mistakes

- Posting without hashtags
- Using tags nobody else uses
- Relying only on popular tags where posts get buried
- Adding irrelevant hashtags

## Numbers and dates

Use `#year2024` for years because numeric only hashtags like `#2024` don't work on Mastodon.

## Beyond hashtags

- Engage with hashtag communities
- Join Mastodon groups for wider reach
- Post when your audience is active
- Participate in conversations instead of only broadcasting

Hashtags are essential for discovery on Mastodon. Use them consistently to help people find your content and connect with communities that share your interests.
