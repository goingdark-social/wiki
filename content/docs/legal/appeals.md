## How to appeal

- Use the in-app Appeal button on the warning page. If the site is unavailable, send a DM to `@fanfare@goingdark.social`.
- Include links to the affected posts or your profile, and any context you believe is relevant.

## What happens next

- Appeals are reviewed by at least two moderators/admins.
- We aim to respond in a timely, objective, and non-discriminatory manner.
- Temporary safeguards may remain in place during review if needed to protect the service.
