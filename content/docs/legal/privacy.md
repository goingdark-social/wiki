# What information do we collect?

* **Basic account information**: username, email, password hash. Optional profile fields such as display name, biography, avatar, and header image. Your username, display name, biography, avatar, and header image are public.
* **Content and social graph**: posts, media, polls, lists, bookmarks, boosts, favourites, follows and followers, mutes and blocks. Public and unlisted posts are public. Featuring a post on your profile makes it public.
* **Direct and followers-only posts**: stored and processed to deliver messages to intended recipients. They may be delivered to other servers where copies are stored. Operators of this server and administrators of receiving servers can technically access such messages. Recipients can screenshot or reshare. Do not share sensitive information over Mastodon.
* **Session and security data**: IP addresses and timestamps when you log in or perform key actions, session tokens, and login history. We don't track you across sites and we don't perform device fingerprinting.
* **Server logs**: minimal HTTP access and error logs needed for reliability and security.

You can export your data and media via Settings - Export. You can irreversibly delete your account in Settings - Delete account.

# What do we use your information for?

We process only what's necessary to run a Mastodon server. Each purpose has a lawful basis under EU law:

* **Operate your account and deliver the service**: account creation, timelines, delivery of posts and direct messages, necessary service emails such as verification and password resets.
  **Legal basis**: contract necessity, Article `6(1)(b)` GDPR.
* **Community safety, moderation, and network security**: prevent spam and ban evasion, investigate abuse reports, protect accounts, maintain service integrity. This includes limited IP logging and review of server logs when needed.
  **Legal basis**: legitimate interests, `Article 6(1)(f) GDPR`, supported by Recital 49 on network and information security. You may object to this processing as described in **Your rights**.

# How do we protect your information?

We apply appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption in transit, strong password hashing, optional two factor authentication, least privilege access, audit logging for administrative actions, secure encrypted backups with rotation, and regular security updates. Access to personal data is restricted to administrators with a need to know.

If a personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to your rights and freedoms, we will notify the competent supervisory authority and affected users when required by law.

# What's Our Data Retention Policy?

We keep data only as long as needed for the stated purposes and then delete or anonymize it.

* **Account and profile**: retained while the account is active. Deleted when you delete your account, subject to backup rotation and limited moderation records as noted below.
* **Posts and media**: retained until you delete them or delete your account. Copies on remote servers are outside our control.
* **IP addresses and login history**: retained up to 90 days by default for security and anti-abuse. We keep entries longer only for active investigations or where required by law, and we review extended entries regularly.
* **Server logs**: retained up to 90 days by default, shorter where feasible.
* **Backups**: encrypted backups retained up to 30 days before rotation. Used only for disaster recovery.

# Do we use cookies?

We only use strictly necessary session cookies required for login and to keep you authenticated. We don't use analytics, advertising, or other nonessential cookies.

# Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We don't sell or trade personal data. We disclose data only to:

* **Our service providers** that act as processors under our instructions to host or deliver the service. We use EU providers where possible. If processing requires transfers outside the EU, we apply appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or rely on an adequacy decision.
* **Other Mastodon servers** that receive your content so your followers and recipients can see it. These servers are independent controllers and apply their own rules.
* **Law enforcement or authorities** when required by EU or Member State law. We don't disclose personal data directly to non-EU authorities unless required under an international agreement or another lawful transfer mechanism under Chapter V GDPR. Where permitted, we will notify affected users.

# Federation and recipients

Mastodon is federated. When you post or interact with accounts on other servers, your content and profile data are delivered to those servers so that people there can see it.

* **Independent controllers**: remote servers determine their own purposes and means of processing. We can't force them to delete or modify data they store.
* **International transfers**: federation can deliver content to servers outside the EU. This is inherent to ActivityPub. You can manage federation through your own posting choices and follower approvals.

# Deletions and limits in a federated network

* When you delete a post or your account, we promptly send delete requests to known recipients using ActivityPub.
* We can't guarantee that every remote server or user will comply with a delete request or remove cached copies, screenshots, or downloads. This is a technical and legal limitation of a federated network.

# Your rights

Subject to conditions in the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectification, erasure, restriction, data portability, and to object to processing based on legitimate interests. You can withdraw consent at any time for processing that relies on consent. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. In Sweden, this is IMY (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten) at [https://www.imy.se](https://www.imy.se).

To exercise your rights, email `dsa-contact@goingdark.social`. We will respond within one month or explain if an extension is needed for complex requests.

# Site usage by children

The service is for adults only. You must be at least 18 years old to create an account and use goingdark.social. We don't knowingly process data from users under 18. If we become aware that someone under 18 is using the service, we will close the account and remove the data.

# Necessity of providing data

Providing basic account data is necessary to enter into and perform the service contract. If you don't provide a username, email, and password, you can't create an account. Providing other profile fields is optional.

# Automated decision making

We use automated tools to detect spam, malware links, mass-registration, and ban evasion. These tools may temporarily limit actions or visibility to protect the service. Any meaningful moderation outcome or lasting restriction is reviewed and decided by a human. We therefore don't make solely automated decisions that produce legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affect you under Article 22 GDPR. You can appeal any moderation action as described in our Community Guidelines. Processing for these tools relies on our legitimate interests in service security and abuse prevention under Article 6 GDPR.

# Changes to this policy

We will post changes to this page with a new Last updated date. If changes are material, we will also publish a notice within the service. Continued use of the service after the effective date means you accept the updated policy.
