# Inauthentic behavior playbook

## Scope
Covers coordinated or deceptive actions to mislead users.  
This connects to [Rule 9 - Honest identity](/docs/policies/rules/09_honest-identity/).

## Why this matters
Authenticity builds trust. When accounts coordinate to mislead people, whether through fake engagement or hidden networks, it skews conversations and erodes credibility. We want real voices, not manufactured consensus.

## How we handle this
We limit the reach of suspected networks while we investigate. If we confirm a coordinated effort to deceive, those accounts get suspended. We note account IDs, related domains, and coordination signals so we can spot patterns.

## What people can expect
Our notice reads: "Coordinated manipulation isn't allowed. We've restricted your account's reach." If deception continues, suspension follows.

## Protecting the wider community
We will limit or block entire networks or servers that exist to manipulate conversations, keeping their influence away from our members.

## If you disagree
Operators can appeal with proof of authenticity or context we missed. We keep evidence for 90 days to review these appeals fairly.
