# Spam playbook

## Scope
Covers unsolicited bulk messages or repetitive content.  
This connects to [Rule 3 - No spam](/docs/policies/rules/03_no-spam/).

## Why this matters
Nobody joined this community to see their timeline flooded with ads or repetitive content. Spam drowns out real conversations and makes it harder for people to connect with each other. We keep timelines clean so everyone can focus on the discussions that matter to them.

## How we handle this
When we spot spam, we remove the posts right away. For a first offense, we usually warn the person and explain why their content was problematic. If someone keeps posting spam after being warned, or if an account is only here to advertise, we'll limit its reach or suspend it entirely.

We keep track of account details, problem posts, and examples of the spam content to make sure our decisions are consistent and fair.

## What people can expect
When we take action against spam, the message is straightforward: "Repetitive promotional content makes timelines harder to use for everyone. We've limited your account to preserve the community experience."

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that regularly send spam our way get limited or blocked to keep our timelines clean. When we limit an entire domain, we call the action a limit.

## If you disagree
Appeals are welcome if someone can show their messages were actually requested or if there was a misunderstanding. We hold onto evidence for 90 days to handle these situations properly.
