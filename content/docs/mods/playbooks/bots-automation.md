# Bots / automated activity playbook

## Scope
Covers unapproved bots, automation, or fake engagement.  
This connects to [Rule 13 - No unapproved bots](/docs/policies/rules/13_bots/).

## Why this matters
Our community runs on real conversations. When automated accounts flood timelines or fake engagement, it drowns out the human voices people come on Mastodon to hear. We only allow bots that have been approved and marked so people know who they're talking to.

## How we handle this
Unapproved bots get suspended as soon as we spot them. If an approved bot misbehaves, we reach out to the operator with a warning and give them a chance to fix the issue. Continued problems lead to limits or suspension. We note account details, bot settings, and sample posts so we can stay consistent.

## What people can expect
When we remove or limit a bot, we send a short note: "Automated accounts require prior approval. We've limited or suspended this bot because it operated outside the policy."

## Protecting the wider community
Remote servers that send noisy or malicious bots our way will be limited or blocked to keep timelines readable for everyone.

## If you disagree
Bot operators can appeal after correcting the problem or providing context we missed. We keep records for 90 days to review these requests fairly.
