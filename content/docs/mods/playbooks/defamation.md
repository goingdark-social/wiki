# Defamation playbook

## Scope
Covers false statements harming someone's reputation.  
This connects to [Rule 1 - Treat people well](/docs/policies/rules/01_treat-people-well/).

## Why this matters
Baseless accusations or rumors can damage someone's reputation and sense of safety. We want discussions to be honest and fair, so we step in when content crosses that line.

## How we handle this
When we confirm a post includes defamatory claims, we remove it. For first-time mistakes, we usually send a warning explaining why the content was removed. Repeated or severe cases lead to limits or suspension. We keep track of account details, post links, and any context from reports to stay consistent.

## What people can expect
Our notice could say: "False statements about others violate our rules. We've removed the post and limited your account while things cool off."

## Protecting the wider community
If another server consistently hosts defamatory posts, we will limit or block it to keep that noise away from our members.

## If you disagree
You can appeal and share supporting evidence if we misunderstood the situation. We keep records for 90 days to review these requests fairly.
