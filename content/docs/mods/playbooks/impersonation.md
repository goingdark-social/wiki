# Impersonation playbook

## Scope
Covers accounts pretending to be someone else.  
This connects to [Rule 9 - Honest identity](/docs/policies/rules/09_honest-identity/).

## Why this matters
Impersonation confuses people and undermines trust. Whether it's a fake celebrity account or someone pretending to be your friend, it can mislead our community. We want folks to know who they're talking to.

## How we handle this
We look at intent. Parody accounts are fine as long as the profile makes it clear they're joking. Accounts that try to deceive others get suspended. We document account IDs, profile screenshots, and reports so we can compare cases.

## What people can expect
Our notice says: "Impersonation without clear parody labels isn't allowed. We've suspended the account until it's corrected."

## Protecting the wider community
If another server hosts a network of impersonators, we may limit or block that server to keep our members from being misled.

## If you disagree
Appeals should include proof you're authorized to run the account or details we missed. We keep records for 90 days to review these situations fairly.
