# Human exploitation playbook

## Scope
Covers trafficking, forced labor, or similar abuse.  
This connects to [Rule 6 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/06_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
Exploiting people for labor or sex is illegal and cruel. We want our community to be a place that stands firmly against abuse, so we remove these posts immediately and cooperate with authorities when necessary.

## How we handle this
We delete the content and suspend the account right away, then alert the administrators. If the situation requires it, we report details to law enforcement. We note account IDs, links, and any recruitment info so investigators have what they need.

## What people can expect
If we suspend an account for this, the notice reads: "Human exploitation is illegal. We've reported the content and suspended your account."

## Protecting the wider community
Servers that promote or tolerate exploitation are blocked or limited to keep that material away from our members.

## If you disagree
Appeals are only considered if we made an error. We keep evidence for one year for potential investigations or appeals.
