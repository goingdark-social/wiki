# Intellectual property playbook

## Scope
Covers copyright or trademark violations.  
This connects to [Rule 4 - No illegal content](/docs/policies/rules/04_no-illegal-content/).

## Why this matters
We respect creators' rights. Sharing someoneâ€™s work without permission can lead to legal issues and erode trust among members.

## How we handle this
When we receive a valid complaint, we remove the infringing content. First-time issues usually come with a warning, but repeated violations lead to suspension. We keep account IDs, URLs, and any removal notices on file.

## What people can expect
Our notice states: "Your post was removed for violating intellectual property rights."

## Protecting the wider community
We share relevant notices with other servers and will block persistent offenders so the infringement doesn't spread.

## If you disagree
You can appeal with proof you have the rights to the material. We keep evidence for 90 days while reviewing these appeals.
