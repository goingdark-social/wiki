# Misinformation playbook

## Scope
Covers false or misleading information that can cause harm.  
This connects to [Rule 1 - Treat people well](/docs/policies/rules/01_treat-people-well/).

## Why this matters
Bad information spreads fast and can hurt people. We want our community to be a place where folks can trust what they read, so we tackle harmful misinformation quickly.

## How we handle this
We label or remove posts that spread dangerous misinformation. First-time offenders get a warning and often see their post labeled instead of removed. If someone keeps sharing harmful rumors after we've reached out, we limit their reach or suspend the account. We track account IDs, post links, and any cited sources to keep our actions grounded in evidence.

## What people can expect
Our message will say: "Spreading false information that harms others isn't allowed. We've removed the post to keep discussions accurate."

## Protecting the wider community
If a server or network regularly spreads coordinated misinformation, we will limit or block it to keep our members from being misled.

## If you disagree
You can appeal with credible sources or context. We keep evidence for 90 days so we can review appeals fairly.
