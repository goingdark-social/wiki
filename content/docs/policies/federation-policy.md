Federation decisions follow clear criteria. Domains that respect privacy and conduct standards meet the inclusion requirements.

Defederation may occur in cases of:

- Persistent spam or harassment.
- Lack of moderation.
- Technical abuse.

A temporary block list is used to review domains. Each entry on the list includes the domain name, the reason for the block, and the date it was added.

Guidance comes from the Internet Foundation for Transparency and Accountability in Social Media (IFTAS). Federation policies undergo periodic review.

Blocks are reviewed **monthly**, and a transparency log of changes is published.

It's important to note that federation blocks only impact the local appearance of content; remote servers aren't affected.
