Bigotry and threats shut down conversation. Attacks based on gender, nationality, religion, race, age, disability, or orientation aren’t welcome. Argue about pizza toppings or systemd all you want, but keep people out of harm’s way. Serious cases lead to immediate suspension, and other situations earn a warning under the [Moderation Guidelines](/docs/policies/moderation-guidelines/).
